Final Project Assignment 2
Release on: Wednesday 4/3/2024
Due on Sunday, 4/28/2023 @ 11:59pm via Blackboard

Project Description

Write a Python program that display the menu:
1.	Calculate Student GPA
2.  Lottery Number Generator
3.  Pig Latin
4.  Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
9.  Exit

The program must have a function main() that display the menu above to let users select one of the 4 options. Each option is equivalent to a function call such as calculate_student_gpa, lottery_number_generator, pig_latin, rock_paper_scissors_game.
Quick hints: this means you're using both if __name__ == '__main__':  AND def main()  in your program.
The main function should be placed at the BOTTOM of your program right before the statement if __name__ == '__main__'.

Submission requirement:
You are asked to submit 2 files: a source code file (in .py file extension) and a project/course reflection (in .pdf or .docx file extension).
If you submit the wrong source code file extension and/or wrong file format, then it is automatically graded a zero for this final project.
It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to screenshot proof of submission right after uploading the project in Blackboard as a backup evident.
The source code must be well-commented. The bare minimum is as follows:
Every function and class must be commented and described.
