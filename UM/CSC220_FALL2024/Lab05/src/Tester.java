    /*
     * Suggested Testing Strategy for Lab:
     * 1. Create an empty **SortedBinarySet**.
     * 2. Check its size and whether it is empty.
     * 3. Start adding a few numbers to your **SortedBinarySet** and ensure they are
     * added properly (i.e., they are in the sorted order, and the other member
     * variables reflect the changes).
     * 4. Continue adding values to your **SortedBinarySet** until you go beyond its
     * original capacity. Ensure no errors occur in this case and that the
     * **SortedBinarySet** does indeed grow.
     * 5. Test your `clear()` method to see if all elements are removed from the
     * **SortedBinarySet**.
